navigation.css
==============

Mobile friendly navigation menu entirely in CSS using input:focus

Using the input's `focus` event a mobile menu can be toggled with only CSS. I prefer this method to the alternative ["CSS Checkbox"](http://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/) method because the menu will disapper when `focus` is lost without forcing further action from the user.

##Setup

Copy the contents of `navigation.html` into your HTML, and replace appropriate links and titles. Link in the CSS. Thats it!
